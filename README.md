# This is about me!

part 2, but was just normal typing with a little twist here and there, I'll keep it short.

## Let's get to the point

I'm Sandip, a **selective** knowledge(and food) hungry individual(*note the word selective*). It means 
that I gorge on certain facts and dishes which grab my attention.

## That's it
